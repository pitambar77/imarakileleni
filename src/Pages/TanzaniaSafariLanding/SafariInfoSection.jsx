              “We are seasoned off-the-beaten-track travellers and I marvel
              that everything worked exactly as it was supposed to,” wrote a
              recent traveller of his Expert Africa safari. “Here we were, in
              the middle of central Tanzania, waiting for a 10:05 flight.
              Guess what? At 10:03, there was the plane, buzzing animals off
              the grass runway, then touching down to pick us up. It happened
              every time. Dazzling!”
            </p>

            <p>
              The same traveller went on to describe visceral wildlife
              encounters: “Having a leopard on your tent porch is not
              something I will soon forget. This is not Disneyland.”
            </p>

            <p>
              Not Disneyland could be Tanzania’s national motto. “We had to
              keep pinching ourselves,” wrote a first-time visitor, “that we
              were actually there, in the places we had only read about or
              seen on TV.”

            <p>
              Tanzania makes a sensational impact. Over one-third of this
              expansive land is dedicated to safeguarding its diverse array
              of wildlife: an irresistible draw for the adventurous.

              Tanzania’s tropical coast, sun-dappled beaches and scattering
              of islands are equally fascinating. Here cosmopolitan towns
              date back centuries to early trade routes and secluded Indian
              Ocean islands lie surrounded by white-sand beaches and
              colourful coral reefs.
