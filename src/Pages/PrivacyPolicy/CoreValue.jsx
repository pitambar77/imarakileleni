          <p>
            Our lifeblood is good communication. Our travellers tell us what
            they want, what they need, and we listen. Then we deliver it. We
            communicate openly and honestly, ensuring that travellers’
            expectations are met. At Imara Kileleni Safaris communication means
            that everyone understands what is required, that everyone is on the
            same page. If our traveller has a special dietary requirement, we
            ensure that the hotels and safari camps are aware of this and meet
            their needs; if travellers have specific wish-lists of wildlife they
            want to see out on safari, our driver-guides will bend over
            backwards to try and fulfill them.
