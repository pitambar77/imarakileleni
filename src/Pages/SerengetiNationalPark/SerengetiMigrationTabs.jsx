          The journey for the key players in the Great Migration, the roughly
          two million wildebeest, starts in the south of the Serengeti, with the
          birth of half a million calves between January and March. A favourite
          season for many of the seasoned Serengeti guides: the air during these
          months is full of new life and action. Read all about Africa's biggest
          wildlife event on this page.

        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-[15px]">
          A better representation of the circle of life probably cannot be found
          anywhere else in the world. The journey starts in Southern Serengeti
          when wildebeest calves are being born. Predators like lions and hyenas
          are constantly hunting for babies, and thousands and thousands of
          calves are born within a couple weeks of each other – a feast for the
          eyes of true wildlife enthusiasts. But seeing a group of lions
          collaborating to hunt down a wildebeest is an unforgettable sight.
